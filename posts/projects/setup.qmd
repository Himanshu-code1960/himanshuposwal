# Installation & Setup:

To get started with `scikit-image`, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Python 

Ensure you have Python installed. You can download the latest version from <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/" target="_blank">Python's official website</a> and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

To verify the installation, run:

```python
python --version
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Using a virtual environment helps manage dependencies effectively.

On macOS/Linux:

```python
python -m venv scikit_env
source scikit_env/bin/activate
```

On Windows:

```python
python -m venv scikit_env
scikit_env\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install `scikit-image`

Use pip to install `scikit-image`:

```python
pip install scikit-image
```

You may also need to install dependencies like `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scipy`:

```python
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

### 4. Verify Installation

After installation, open a Python shell and run:

```python
import skimage
print(skimage.__version__)
```

If no errors appear and a version number is printed, the installation was successful.

### 5. Installing Jupyter Notebook (For Interactive Development)

If you want an interactive development environment, install Jupyter Notebook:

```python
pip install notebook
```

Then, launch it using:

```python
jupyter notebook
```

### 6. Running Your First `scikit-image` Program

Create a Python script or Jupyter Notebook and test loading an image:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from skimage import io

image = io.imread('https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Portrait_Placeholder.png')
plt.imshow(image)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

If an image is displayed without errors, your setup is complete!
